# Foodborne bacterial WGS training

In this training course you will find theory and practice material for introducing yourself to wgs analysis for foodborne bacteria. [Here you will find the agenda](https://usegalaxy.eu/training-material/).

The material includes slides with theory concepts and a practical exercises using [Galaxy trainings](), focusing on the interpretation of results.

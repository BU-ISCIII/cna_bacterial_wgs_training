# Foodborne bacterial WGS training

In this training course you will find theory and practice material for introducing yourself to wgs analysis for foodborne bacteria. [Here you will find the agenda](slides/Programa_CNA_wgs_20221011_v2.docx.pdf).

The material includes slides with theory concepts and a practical exercises using [Galaxy trainings](https://usegalaxy.eu/training-material/), focusing on the interpretation of results.
